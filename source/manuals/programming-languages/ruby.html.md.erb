## Code formatting

The GOV.UK programme publishes and maintains a gem, [rubocop-govuk], which
provides linting rules for Ruby projects. These rules extend those
described in [rubystyle.guide], which is a good starting point for
the underlying conventions. The rubocop-govuk project has overriden rules to
rules to either match pre-existing GDS prcedence or to handle scenarios where
rules were problematic to adopt.

## Conventional tooling

GDS uses the [MRI][mri-ruby] implementation of Ruby in projects. You should not
adopt a different one, such as [jRuby], for projects without clear justification.
The recommended tool for managing multiple Ruby installations is [rbenv].
For dependendency management [bundler] should be used.

For web applications, the de facto approach is to use [Ruby on Rails], for
smaller web applications we have chosen [Sinatra] before - however this
should be approached with caution as, with iteration, these can easily become
large applications that are less conventionally organised than Rails
applications.

For testing the use of [RSpec] library is the more common within GDS, and thus
preferred, than using the other major framework, minitest. New Ruby projects
should adopt RSpec.
