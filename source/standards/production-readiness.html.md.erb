Before taking your service into production and introducing it to live users, make sure it meets the technical standards set by GDS and your team.

Some of these standards are in the GDS Way but your team may also have its own specific standards. For example, you may need to connect your service to [Logit][] before going to production.

If you do not follow the standards, such as [alerting][], you could have difficulties operating or supporting your service if problems arise.

Read the [Service Manual][] for more information about building and running a live service.

## Use a checklist

To avoid problems when your service goes into production, use a checklist. Each check should reference a standard thatâ€™s already in place before you can put a service into production. An example is [documenting architecture decisions].

Include communication checks to make sure specific groups or individuals are informed in advance. For example, senior management or specific user groups.

Save your checklist as a template so your team can apply it to each new service or subcomponent.

### Example checklist

To take a service into production, it must be possible to:

* search logs
* monitor its health
* view application metrics
* alert people when the service has problems
* follow a documented deployment process

You must also:

* have agreement to proceed from [Information Assurance (IA)][]
* inform PERSON A
* inform GROUP B
